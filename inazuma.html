            <h1>INAZUMA</h1>
            <p>An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat
Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho.
Inazuma's most lively and prosperous area, where most of Inazuma's population lives. From Hanamizaka to the streets of the city, you can follow the trail to visit local traditional shops and sample Inazuma specialties.

The Tenryou Commission is also located in the city, governing matters concerning public order and security, as well as the Shogunate's military affairs.

At the top of Inazuma City is Tenshukaku, where the Raiden Shogun resides and rules over Inazuma.
